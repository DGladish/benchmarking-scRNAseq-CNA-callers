# attempt 1 - from GPT-4o
```{r}
#install.packages("IRanges")  # from Bioconductor if not already installed
library(IRanges)
```

## Simulated example segment data (replace with your own)
```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Simulate 50 segments across a 5 million bp region
n_segments <- 50
chrom_length <- 5e6

# Random start positions
segment_starts <- sort(sample(1:(chrom_length - 10000), n_segments))
segment_ends <- segment_starts + sample(1000:50000, n_segments, replace = TRUE)

# Cap segment ends at chrom_length
segment_ends[segment_ends > chrom_length] <- chrom_length

# Random copy numbers (e.g., 0 to 6)
copy_numbers <- sample(0:6, n_segments, replace = TRUE)

# Build the data frame
segments <- data.frame(
  start = segment_starts,
  end = segment_ends,
  copy_number = copy_numbers
)
```

## Ted feedback: subtract 2 from all copy number values
```{r}
segments$copy_number <- segments$copy_number-2
print(segments$copy_number)
```


## Create Genomic Windows and Calculate Weighted Averages
```{r}
# Create IRanges object for segments
seg_ranges <- IRanges(start = segments$start, end = segments$end)

# Set up fixed windows of 200kb
window_size <- 200000
windows <- IRanges(start = seq(1, chrom_length, by = window_size), width = window_size)

weighted_avgs <- sapply(seq_along(windows), function(i) { # 
  
  win <- windows[i] # win is a IRanges who's length of start and width = 1 (information start position and width of window[i])
  win_repeated <- rep(win, length(seg_ranges))
  overlaps <- pintersect(seg_ranges, win_repeated, resolve.empty = "start")
  overlap_widths <- width(overlaps)
  
  valid_idx <- which(overlap_widths > 0)
  if (length(valid_idx) == 0) return(NA) # Function returns NA whenever a given window doesn't overlap with ANY segment.
  
  overlap_weights <- overlap_widths[valid_idx] / width(win)
  copy_vals <- segments$copy_number[valid_idx]
  
  #if (length(valid_idx==1)) {copy_vals
  #} else {sum(copy_vals * overlap_weights)} # sum(copy_vals * overlap_weights) I added in the if statement as in my head it doesn't make sense to shrink the copy number if there is only 1 segment.
  
  sum(copy_vals * overlap_weights)
  
})

print(weighted_avgs)
```
## Ted feedback: now add 2 back!
```{r}
weighted_avgs <- weighted_avgs+2
print(weighted_avgs)
```
